<h1>Revelation</h1>
<br>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>
    We make ourselves a place apart
    <br>
    &emsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,
    <br>
    But oh, the agitated heart
    <br>
    &emsp;Till someone find us really out.
</p>

<p>
    'Tis pity if the case require
    <br>
    &emsp;(Or so we say) that in the end
    <br>
    We speak the literal to inspire
    <br>
    &emsp;The understanding of a friend.
    </p>

<p>
    But so with all, from babes that play
    <br>
    &emsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,
    <br>
    So all who hide too well away
    <br>
    &emsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.
</p>
